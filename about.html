				<p>Well, the story of CharityMiner starts out with two high schoolers, let's call them Rad and Biscuit, who are at the town library, "working" on a project. Biscuit says to Rad, (the following is shortened because Biscuit tends to ramble..) blah blah blah mining cryptocurrency through a website. And at that moment the idea was formed. They bought in their friend, Coffee, and the idea morphed into having a website where people can simply click to mine cryptocurrency for the poor.</p>
