				What even is this site?

			</div>	
			<div class="explanation-header">
				Where does this money go?
			</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				This money, after you and others have mined enough coins, will be converted into either USD or Euros and then 91% goes to Charity.
			</div>
			<div class="explanation-header">
				Where does the 9% go?
			</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				The 9% of money that is earned goes to the contributor of this website <a href="about.html">(Find us here)</a>.
			</div>
			<div class="explanation-header">
				What happens when I sign up?
			</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				The website creates an account for you (You have to provide email address, and name), and then it keeps track of how many Verge coins you have mined.
			</div>
			<div class="explanation-header">
				What can I do with the progress I have made?
			</div>
			<div class="explanation">
