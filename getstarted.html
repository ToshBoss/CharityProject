		What even is this site?
	</h1>
	<h1 class="explanation">
		Well, this site uses a Javascript code to mine Verge Coins using your CPU (Central Processing Unit).
	</h1>	
	<h1 class="explanation">
		Where does this money go?
	</h1>
	<h1 class="explanation">
		This money, after you and others have mined enough coins, will be converted into either USD or Euros and then 91% goes to Charity.
	</h1>
	<h1 class="explanation">
		Where does the 9% go?
	</h1>
	<h1 class="explanation">
		The 9% of money that is earned goes to the contributor of this website <a href="about.html">(Find us here)</a>.
	</h1>
	<h1 class="explanation">
		What happens when I sign up?
	</h1>
	<h1 class="explanation">
		The website creates an account for you (You have to provide email address, and name), and then it keeps track of how many Verge coins you have mined.
	</h1>
	<h1 class="explanation">
		What can I do with the progress I have made?
	</h1>
	<h1 class="explanation">
		You have bragging rights to all the people you met and you can tell them how much of a good person you are by showing them your progress in mining for Charity.
