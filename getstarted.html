	<p class="anwser">Well it's simple, when you connect to this website, you can access a page that allows you us to use your CPU (the brains of your computer) to mine a cryptocurrency named Monero, which we will then donate 90% of to a charity. We reccomend that you connect here when you aren't using your computer.</p>
	<p class="question"><b>Why does 90% go, what happens to the other 10%</b></p>
	<p class="anwser">As we are trying to grow and maintain the website, we use the money to support the cost of hosting the website, and getting the word out.</p>
	<p class="question"><b>Is it safe?</b></p>
	<p class="anwser">Yes! We're just a couple of people wanting to help the poor while working on a pretty cool concept website.</p>
	<p class="question"><b>Will this affect my computer?</b></p>
	<p class="anwser">Depending on the speed that you set the miner to, the CPU can experience a higher level of workload, but OSX and Windows have built in protections to "throttle" the CPU to keep it in safe tempratures and loads. You may want to set the speed lower if you want to keep the computer cool and running at a regular pace.</p>
	<p class="question"><b>My computer's fans are running like crazy, what do I do?</b></p>
	<p class="anwser">Relax, its the computer trying to keep cool. If you think it's getting too hot, then you can lower the speed on the miner.</p>
